# RoleByPost

A Discord bot for running play-by-post tabletop RPGs, supporting multiple systems (currently Generic, Fate and Mongoose Traveller 2e). RoleByPost helps manage character sheets, NPCs, scenes, dice rolls, and inventory management, making it easy to run and play pbp games on Discord.

### Character Speech and Narration

This bot provides special message prefixes that transform regular text messages into formatted character speech or GM narration:

- **Speaking as Your Character**  
  `pc::Your character's message here`  
  Displays a message as your currently active character, with their avatar if set.

- **Speaking as a Specific Character/Companion**  
  `pc::Character Name::Message content`  
  Displays a message as the specified character or companion you control.

- **GM: Speaking as NPCs**  
  `npc::NPC Name::Message content`  
  Displays a message as the specified NPC, with their avatar if available.

- **GM: Using Aliases**  
  `npc::NPC Name::Alias::Message content`  
  Lets GMs use an alias for the NPC in this specific message.

- **GM: On-the-fly NPCs**  
  Even if the NPC doesn't exist in the database, the bot creates a temporary character for the message.

- **GM Narration**  
  `gm::Your narration text here`  
  Creates a purple-bordered embed with the GM's avatar for scene descriptions and narration.

- **Character Avatars**  
  Set your character's avatar with `/char set-avatar [url]` to enhance the immersion.

**Channel Restrictions:** Narration commands (`pc::`, `npc::`, `gm::`) are automatically blocked in **Out-of-Character (OOC)** channels to maintain immersion. Use them in **In-Character (IC)** or **Unrestricted** channels.

For more detailed help, use `/char narration-help`.

### Fate System Commands

- `/fate scene aspects`  
  Show all aspects in the current scene including game aspects, scene aspects, zone aspects, and character aspects. GMs can see hidden aspects while players see only visible ones.

**Interactive Aspect Management:**
When viewing a scene in a Fate game, GMs have access to these Fate-specific features:
- **Edit Game Aspects:** Manage server-wide aspects that persist across scenes
- **Edit Scene Aspects:** Manage aspects specific to the current scene  
- **Edit Zones:** Create and manage zone lists and zone-specific aspects

All aspect editing supports:
- Hidden aspects (surround with `*asterisks*`)
- Free invokes (add `[number]` after aspect name)

### Development Prerequisites

- Developed on Python 3.12.10
- A Discord bot token ([how to create one](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- PostgreSQL database server (local or hosted)
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) for environment variable management

### Installation for Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CptConstantine/RoleByPost.git
   cd RoleByPost
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL database**
   - Install PostgreSQL locally or use a hosted service
   - Create a new database for the bot
   - Note your connection details (host, port, database name, username, password)

4. **Set up your environment**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
     ```
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
     ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-here
     ```
   - Replace the `DATABASE_URL` values with your actual PostgreSQL connection details
   - For hosted databases (like Heroku Postgres), use the full connection string provided by your service
   - You can get an encryption key by running `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`

5. **Run the bot**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
   The bot will automatically create the necessary database schema on first run.
