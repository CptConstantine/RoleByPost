## What Information Does RoleByPost Collect?

- **Discord User Data:**  
  The bot stores Discord user IDs, usernames, and avatars to associate characters and actions with users.
- **Server Data:**  
  The bot stores server IDs, channel IDs, and role IDs to manage server-specific settings and permissions.
- **Game Data:**  
  The bot stores character sheets, NPCs, scenes, inventory, and other game-related data as entered by users.
- **Message Content:**  
  The bot processes messages that use its commands or narration prefixes, but does not store general message history.

  If you use AI-powered features (e.g., story recaps, rules questions), relevant message content may be sent to third-party AI providers (such as OpenAI) for processing. These providers have their own privacy policies.
